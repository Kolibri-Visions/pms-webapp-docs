## Completed Phases

### Phase 20: Inventory/Availability Final Validation ✅

**Date Completed:** 2025-12-27 to 2026-01-03

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Manual blocks prevent bookings (409 conflict enforcement)
- ✅ Deleting blocks unblocks inventory immediately
- ✅ Cancel frees inventory instantly
- ✅ Idempotent cancellation (safe retry)
- ✅ Cancelled bookings don't prevent rebooking
- ✅ Race-safe concurrency validated (1 success, rest 409)

**Validation Tools:**
- `pms_phase20_final_smoke.sh` - Core inventory mechanics
- `pms_booking_concurrency_test.sh` - Parallel booking race conditions

**Database Migrations:**
- `20260103120000_ensure_guests_metrics_columns.sql` - Metrics columns (total_bookings, total_spent, last_booking_at)
- `20260103123000_ensure_guests_booking_timeline_columns.sql` - Timeline columns (first_booking_at, average_rating, updated_at, deleted_at)

**Documentation:**
- Runbook troubleshooting sections for schema drift
- Scripts README updated with auto-pick logic
- Frontend README updated with batch details UI

### Channel Manager Admin UI ✅

**Date Completed:** 2026-01-02 to 2026-01-03

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Sync batches history table with pagination
- ✅ Batch details modal with operation breakdown
- ✅ Direction indicators (→ outbound, ← inbound)
- ✅ Task ID and error message display
- ✅ Auto-refresh for running batches
- ✅ Status filter dropdown (All | Running | Failed | Success)

**API Enhancements:**
- Extended `BatchOperation` model with direction, task_id, error, duration_ms, log_id
- Fixed `list_batch_statuses()` to include all required fields
- Response validation errors resolved

## Current Phase

### Phase 21: Inventory/Availability Production Hardening 🟡

**Date Started:** 2026-01-03
**Status:** In Progress (Docs + Scaffolding)

**Goals:**
- Document common gotchas and operational guidance
- Validate availability API contract (negative tests)
- Plan modular architecture improvements
- Create minimal scaffolds (non-invasive, not wired in)

**Completed in Phase 21:**
- ✅ Runbook section: Phase 21 production hardening guide
  - What Phase 20 proved
  - Common gotchas checklist (422 errors, schema drift)
  - Minimum production checklist
  - Edge cases roadmap
- ✅ Smoke script: `pms_phase21_inventory_hardening_smoke.sh`
  - Negative test: Missing query params → 422
  - Positive test: Valid availability query → 200
  - Read-only (no side effects)
- ✅ Scripts README documentation for Phase 21 smoke
- ✅ Architecture doc: `modular_monolith_phase21.md`
  - ModuleSpec pattern definition
  - Example module specs (inventory, channel_manager)
  - Registry pattern design
  - Migration strategy (Phase 21-24 timeline)
- ✅ Code scaffold: `backend/app/modules/module_spec.py`
  - ModuleSpec dataclass with validation
  - Example module definitions (docs only)
  - NOT wired into runtime (Phase 22+)

**What's Next:**
- Edge cases validation:
  - Back-to-back bookings (end-exclusive semantics)
  - Timezone boundaries (DST, UTC midnight)
  - Min stay constraints
  - Booking window rules (max future days)
  - Malformed date handling

## Test Coverage Status

### Smoke Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Status | Last Run |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| `pms_phase20_final_smoke.sh` | Core inventory validation | ✅ PASS | 2026-01-03 |
| `pms_booking_concurrency_test.sh` | Race-safe concurrency | ✅ PASS | 2026-01-03 |
| `pms_phase21_inventory_hardening_smoke.sh` | API contract validation | ✅ NEW | 2026-01-03 |
| `pms_phase23_smoke.sh` | Quick confidence check | ✅ PASS | 2025-12-27 |

### Integration Tests

- Backend integration tests: ✅ Passing (pytest)
- Frontend build: ✅ Passing (npm run build)
- Database migrations: ✅ Up-to-date (Supabase)

## Database Schema Status

### Current Schema Version

- Supabase migrations: Up-to-date
- Last migration: `20260103123000_ensure_guests_booking_timeline_columns.sql`

### Recent Schema Changes

**Guests Table Enhancements:**
- Metrics columns: `total_bookings`, `total_spent`, `last_booking_at`
- Timeline columns: `first_booking_at`, `average_rating`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`
- Indexes: `idx_guests_last_booking_at`, `idx_guests_first_booking_at`, `idx_guests_deleted_at`

**Exclusion Constraints:**
- `bookings.no_double_bookings` - Race-safe overlap prevention (GIST)

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

### Phase 21 Tech Debt

- [ ] Module bootstrap is still manual (routers mounted in main.py)
  - **Mitigation:** ModuleSpec scaffold created, registry pattern designed
  - **Timeline:** Integration planned for Phase 22

- [ ] No automated tests for availability API edge cases yet
  - **Mitigation:** Smoke scripts provide basic coverage
  - **Timeline:** Integration tests planned for Phase 21.5

### Monitoring Gaps

- [ ] No production metrics dashboard yet
  - **Impact:** Low (logs provide visibility)
  - **Priority:** Medium (Phase 22+)

- [ ] Admin console lacks WebSocket support (polling instead)
  - **Impact:** Low (3-second polling acceptable)
  - **Priority:** Low (future enhancement)

## Next Steps (Phase 21+)

### Immediate (Phase 21 Completion)

1. Run Phase 21 smoke script in production to validate contract
2. Review modular architecture design with team
3. Document any additional edge cases discovered
4. Update runbook with production deployment experience

### Short-term (Phase 22)

1. Wire ModuleSpec registry into `main.py` bootstrap
2. Create module specs for all existing features
3. Add module dependency resolution
4. Add lifecycle hooks (on_startup, on_shutdown)

### Medium-term (Phase 23-24)

1. Split large modules based on bounded contexts
2. Add module health checks
3. Consider dynamic module loading (hot reload for dev)
4. Implement min_stay and booking_window validation

### Long-term (Phase 25+)

1. Module marketplace consideration (third-party plugins)
2. Selective deployment (disable unused modules)
3. Gradual microservices migration (if needed)

## Deployment Status

### Production Environment

- **Backend API:** Deployed on Coolify
- **Frontend Admin:** Deployed on Coolify
- **Database:** Supabase (managed PostgreSQL)
- **Workers:** Celery + Redis (deployed)

### Environment Variables

All required environment variables configured:
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL`
- ✅ `JWT_SECRET`
- ✅ `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (CORS configured)
- ✅ `CHANNEL_MANAGER_ENABLED=true`
