## Risk Mitigation

### MVP Risks

**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities found late in MVP development
**Mitigation**: Security audit scheduled for 2026-02-28 (1 month before launch)

**Risk**: Double-booking edge cases not covered by EXCLUSION constraint
**Mitigation**: Extensive integration testing, manual QA with concurrent booking scenarios

**Risk**: Performance degradation under load
**Mitigation**: Load testing scheduled for 2026-03-15 (2 weeks before launch)

---

### Beta Risks

**Risk**: Channel Manager sync failures (API rate limits, auth issues)
**Mitigation**: Circuit breaker, exponential backoff, comprehensive logging

**Risk**: Stripe payment failures (network issues, fraud detection)
**Mitigation**: Retry logic, webhook verification, fallback to manual payment

**Risk**: Conflict resolution complexity (multiple channels book same dates)
**Mitigation**: Conservative availability buffer, manual conflict resolution UI

---

### Prod-Ready Risks

**Risk**: Scaling bottlenecks (database, API, Redis)
**Mitigation**: Horizontal scaling tested in Beta, database connection pooling tuned

**Risk**: Custom domain setup complexity (DNS, SSL certs)
**Mitigation**: Automated DNS/SSL provisioning (Let's Encrypt), clear docs for agencies

**Risk**: Billing integration bugs (overcharging, undercharging)
**Mitigation**: Extensive billing tests, manual review before first charge

---
